                Hi there! My name is Muhammad Shaikh. During the Summer semester of 2025, I worked remotely as a Software Engineer for DataInn Inc., a company that builds SaaS-based solutions for businesses. I contributed to AutismResourceHub, a online social platform designed to help connect families who have children with autism to support centres and programs. My work focused on resolving critical bugs, developing new features, and optimizing the performance of the application. I collaborated with a distributed team using Microsoft Teams and other tools, ensuring a seamless workflow and a consistent approach to development. This experience helped me grow both technically and professionally, particularly by working with React, Typescript, Node.js, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Drizzle ORM.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 italic text-center">Goals</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
              <strong>  Learning Goal 1: <br>Effectively communicate with team members using Microsoft Teams. </strong><br>
	
Throughout my work term, I focused on improving my written communication using Microsoft Teams. I believe I was successful in this area, as my team members consistently understood my messages and I maintained a professional tone. I also received positive in-person feedback from colleagues who appreciated how I communicated within the team. To ensure clarity and professionalism, I made it a habit to proofread my messages and use grammar-checking tools before sending them. These strategies helped me stay clear and concise, which in turn improved overall communication within the team.


<br><br><strong>Learning Goal 2: <br>	
I want to successfully implement the features by learning the technology required in the main application I am developing to address user needs</strong><br>

	
During my work term, I gained hands-on experience with several new technologies that were essential to the development of the main application. I learned how to use tools such as Replit, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, and TypeScript, and I became familiar with the full software development lifecycle, from addressing user needs and designing the front end to building the middleware and backend, including server-side database management. I also contributed to deploying code and updates to the cloud. When I encountered obstacles, I took initiative by searching for solutions online or reaching out to more experienced team members for guidance. This approach not only helped me overcome technical challenges but also accelerated my learning. By the end of the term, I felt significantly more confident in my ability to use these technologies effectively and independently.

<br><br><strong>Learning Goal 3: <br> 	
I want to be able to communicate effectively when speaking with other team members during meetings. </strong><br>

At the beginning of my work term, I found it challenging to initiate and navigate conversations during meetings, especially since they were conducted over Microsoft Teams and felt similar to phone calls. However, as time went on, I grew more comfortable and confident in my ability to communicate effectively. I learned how to smoothly start conversations, maintain engaging discussions, and end them professionally. This helped me significantly improve my command over verbal communication and overall social interaction in a professional setting. While I didn't end up using cue cards, I did benefit from watching videos and using online resources to learn how to speak more clearly and professionally. Although I didn't receive direct feedback on my oral communication, the fact that my team members consistently engaged in meaningful conversations with me was a strong indicator of my progress

<br><br><strong>Learning Goal 4: <br>I want to be able to professionally manage my time especially since I am working remotely </strong><br>

	
Working remotely required me to be especially intentional about managing my time, and I developed a system that proved to be highly effective. I used Todoist to organize my tasks, setting specific deadlines, reminders, and prioritizing daily responsibilities. Over time, I built a habit of regularly checking the team chats and dedicating significant time each day to focused work. This helped me stay on top of everything without feeling overwhelmed. I didn't face any significant challenges with organization or punctuality, as my checklist approach allowed me to clearly track progress by listing out bugs, features, or required changes and crossing them off as they were completed. This system significantly improved my efficiency, helping me deliver more work in less time and ultimately contributing to a smoother overall project workflow.

<br><br><strong>Learning Goal 5: <br>	
I want to be a leader at the project I am working on and be on top of all the tasks and make sure everyone is on the same page.</strong><br>
	
I was proud to take on a leadership role during my project, acting as the lead developer responsible for a wide range of tasks from fixing bugs and developing new features to testing and deployment. I used Replit extensively and also helped guide another developer by teaching them the same skills I was using and supporting them whenever they faced difficulties. I played an important leadership role by ensuring continuous communication with my teammates, keeping everyone aligned and informed about project progress. My leadership efforts were recognized by my peers, especially when I met with them in person and presented a demo of the project; their positive feedback and gratitude showed me that my contributions were valued and impactful.            </p>

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                In my role as a Software Engineer, I worked across both the frontend and backend of a social platform called AutismResourceHub, designed to help families in the autism community connect with resources, support groups, and local events. The tech stack included React, TypeScript, Node.js, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Drizzle ORM. I also leveraged a custom Replit Agent to assist in developing core platform features—acting as both a system designer and tester to ensure smooth functionality across both the user-facing interface and the developer experience. Key features I implemented included user registration for events, discussion forums, article publishing, resource sharing, user profile creation, and document uploads. I ensured these features were not only functionally complete but also robust through thorough validation, testing, and performance optimization. Additionally, I addressed critical bugs—such as data formatting issues and validation errors—and contributed to a scalable architecture. Working in a remote environment, I collaborated closely with the team during sprint planning, participated in code reviews, and played an active role in maintaining development quality and velocity.

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                In conclusion, my work on Autism ResourceHub significantly contributed to my growth as a full-stack developer. I was deeply involved in building meaningful features for a socially impactful platform, while also addressing critical bugs and ensuring high performance and usability. By leveraging technologies like React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Drizzle ORM—along with a custom Replit Agent—I not only implemented features but also took on system design and testing responsibilities to ensure a seamless experience for both users and developers. This role strengthened my technical skill set, deepened my understanding of full-stack development workflows, and enhanced my collaboration and communication skills in a remote, team-driven environment. Overall, the experience shaped me into a more well-rounded and thoughtful software engineer.
